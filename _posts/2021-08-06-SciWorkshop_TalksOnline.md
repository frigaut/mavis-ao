A very warm **Thank You** to all the participants of the 2021 online MAVIS Science Workshop held last month! We had 140 registrants, with around 60-80 attendees on each of the four 3-hour sessions of talks and fruitful discussions, both live and via the workshop Slack channels. We were extremely pleased to have so much engagement and interest in MAVIS from the community, with many talks presenting new science cases, in addition to synergies with future facilities and updates to the Phase A Science Case.

Missed the workshop? No problem! all talks (live and pre-recorded) and discussion sessions are now available online via the [workshop website](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/1420/).
