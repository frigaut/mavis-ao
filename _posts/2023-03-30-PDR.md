The MAVIS team is pleased to announce that the project has successfully passed its Preliminary Design Review at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) headquarters (and online) on March 30, 2023, pending completion of a few actions. The team has received high praise from the ESO review board for the quality of the documentation, as well as our collaborative spirit and professionalism. More that 60 documents were delivered 7 weeks prior to the review date and we received close to 500 RIXes.

The international MAVIS team gathered either in person or virtually for the MAVIS Preliminary Design Review meeting on March 30th, 2023. 
This is a significant milestone for the MAVIS team and a major accomplishment for the project. Passing the preliminary design review means that the project can move forward to the final design phase. This brings the team one step closer to achieving their ultimate goal of a first light at the end of this decade.
