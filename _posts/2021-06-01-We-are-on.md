  * ESO agreement signed: check
  * Kick-off meeting: check
  * Media release from ESO, Australia (ANU/MQ/AAL) and INAF: check

Good things come to those who wait.

Today, Tuesday 1 June 2021, the ESO-ANU agreement for the design and construction of MAVIS was signed by both parties. It comes after a somewhat lengthy but satisfying process to set up the Technical Requirement Specifications and the Statement of Work.

Today, in less than an hour, we will be having the formal Kick-Off meeting with ESO and the MAVIS consortium. This will mostly focus on formal matters (management, system engineering, product assurance), as we've had most technical matters discussed on 11 June during a successful pre-kick-off with ESO.

Simultaneously, we are doing several media releases, synchronised across ESO, ANU/Macquarie/AAL and INAF. This is embargoed until 1 June 16:00CET (2 June 00:00 in Australia). 

We're ON. This is a great day for MAVIS.
