We are please to announce that recorded talks from the 2021 MAVIS Science Workshop (held online, July 5-8th 2021) are now available via the [workshop website](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/1420/).

This workshop brought together the international scientific community with talks and discussions on key science cases where MAVIS will have a strong impact due to its unparalleled capabilities, as well as identifying areas of unique synergies with existing and forthcoming facilities such as ELTs and JWST. The 4-day workshop involved over 140 particpants from around the globe, with a mix of live talks and panel discussion sessions (3 hours per day), plus a series of pre-recorded talks, with parallel Q&A sessions via a dedicated Slack workspace.
